# DoublePendulum_GUI
This is a small GUI of double pendulum developed for the British Science Festival. This is used to demo that coupled simple systems can create complicated dynamic problems. This is used as a demo to general public to see what is a dynamic problem and why simple systems can model complicated ones.
